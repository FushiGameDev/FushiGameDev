<h2> Some IRL Projects ;)</h2>  
  
  - <b> Rick's Workshop Portal Gun </b> 🔫  
    One time I needed to prepare a costume of Rick. I decided to create a workshop gun simillar to Rick's Portal gun. It shoots with anything you put there but I just used beer caps. It was made with ESP8266 board, leftovers from renovation, glue gun and glass. Made it in 2 days and it was pretty fun to get back to old hobby.
